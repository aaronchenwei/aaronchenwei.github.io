Spring Boot 3.0, the next major revision will be based on Spring Framework 6.0 and Java 17.

> This release includes 135 enhancements, documentation improvements, dependency upgrades, and bug fixes. This is our first release candidate for Spring Boot 3.0, which we expect to release November 24, 2022.

Let's have a quick review on what is new in Java 17.

## 1. New features in Java 17 in comparison with version 8

If you want to check a full list of changes to JDK, you would have already known that they are tracked as JEPs (JDK Enhancement Proposals). The full list can be found in [JEP-0](https://openjdk.org/jeps/0).

Also, if you want to compare Java APIs between versions, there is a great tool called [Java Version Almanac](https://javaalmanac.io/). There were many useful, small additions to Java APIs, and checking this website is likely the best option if someone wants to learn about all these changes.
