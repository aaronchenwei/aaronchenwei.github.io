# Graph Algorithms <!-- omit in toc -->

## 1. Algorithm Types

- **Centrality**
  - Indicators of centrality assign numbers or rankings to nodes within a graph corresponding to their network position
- **Classification**
  - Classify the graph into sets
- **Community**
  - A network is said to have community structure if the nodes of the network can be easily grouped into sets of nodes such that each set of nodes is densely connected internally
- **GraphML/Embeddings**
  - A graph embedding is an approach converting neighborhood topology into a fixed size vector of decimal values
- **Path**
  - Identify path between vertexes and path analytics
- **Similarity**
  - Computes similarity between pairs of items
- **Topological Link Prediction**
  - Link prediction is the problem of predicting the existence of a link between two entities in a network
- **Frequent Pattern Mining**
  - An analytical process that finds frequent patterns
